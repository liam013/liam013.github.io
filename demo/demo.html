              <p class="description"> As a soft spoken, and intropersonal individual photographing strangers was an anxious task that proved exhilerating.  I photographed in black in white as I felt the use of colour would be too distracting and I wanted the main focus of the images to be on the people, their expressions and if shown how they relate to the surrounding environment.  I wanted each image to convey a story and provide a sense of eeriness, discomfort, distress and struggle.</p>

        <p class="description"> There is something inherently calming about nature. An entire ecosystem is largely ignored as we are too focused on the trivial  that clog our social media feeds.  There is a sense of relief, quietude,  a restbit from the chaotic city, when watching out over a lake or being surround by trees.  Personally, I surround myself in nature as a introspective meditation, being left with, thoughts, aspirations, intrigue and ultimately, bliss.</p>

            <p class="description"> Our subconscious is an ominous thing.  With this series I wanted to communicate frustration and distress.  A subject is paradoxically dreaming about insomnia i.e. not being able to sleep.  I feel the paradoxical narrative of this series is powerful, there exists a duplicity in its message and requires the audience to impose their interpretation of the abstract; their interpretation of dreams, psychology, and spirituality.</p>

			<h1 class="title">Artistic Inspiration</h1>
            <div class="box-inspiration">
            <p class="inspiration">My main inspiration for all by photographic work is music.  When I want to communicate a certain message or wrestle with a concept, I will find music that I believe initiates that internal discussion.  In the case of the Street photography, I had Bruce Springsteen&apos;s Born to Run album, as well as Tom Wait&apos;s Small Change album played on repeat for hours while I was in downtown Toronto.</p> 

<p class="inspiration">Music, is a powerful and universal language and has been such a big part of my life.  I naturally gravitate towards music as the absolute form of artistic exactitude; I often consolidate music for comfort, a relief from stress and a banishment from anxiety.</p>  

<p class="inspiration">I would like to highlight one photographer, whose work has stuck with me for the past three years, and that&apos;s Kitra Cahanna. Her work is masterful, and each of her series capitalizes on different photographic techniques.  The series depicting her father, is rich with emotion and even more so with her use of long exposures to capture movement.  The series she did capturing teenagers exemplifies vibrancy and a deft understanding of composition.

            <div class="box-about">
            <p class="about">I am a third year University student, specializing in Digital Communications.  My interests and passions consist of everything and anything involving media and entertainment as a form of expression.  From TV, movies, music and occasionally books, I have emphatically carved out beloved works that I admire, yet I strive to increase my knowledge of artists, directors and authors.</p>  

<p class="about">My favourite TV show is probably Buffy The Vampire Slayer, with its witty humor, ingratiating group dynamic and progressive commentary on abuse, addiction, female empowerment, interracial romance and homosexual main characters which are all rather bold topics for the 1990&apos;s.  However, Breaking Bad, Sopranos, Seinfeld, and The Walking Dead are notable honorable mentions.</p>  

<p class="about">My favourite movies currently are Stanley Kubrick&apos;s The Shining, Michael Haneke&apos;s Amour, and Sam Rami&apos;s Spider-man, an odd mix, I know.</p> 

<p class="about">As far as music, Bruce Springsteen, The Cure, Tom Waits, Tool, Alison Krauss and Canada&apos;s own, Stan Rogers, to name a few, are artists I consistently revisit each of the artists possess a deep catalog of amazing albums.</p> 

<p class="about">Regarding books, my favourite author is Cormac McCarthy, he is most notably author of The Road, No Country For Old Men, and Blood Meridian. McCarthy has a masterful grasp of powerful prose and a profoundly poetic use of language.</p>
