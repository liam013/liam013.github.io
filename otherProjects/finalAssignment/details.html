           <p><strong>Subwoofer Placement:</strong> Having a subwoofer is optional if your set-up is entirely for music, or it might not be possible to place in your set-up given the space.  However, if you have a subwoofer in your set-up, placement is key to ensure the bass isn't overwhelming and isn't underpresented.  Our team will conduct measurements to mathematically determine the optiminal subwoofer placement for your system.</p>
           <p><strong>Reinforce Floors:</strong> This is only for the serious enthusiasts.  If you are looking at speakers in the range of $100,000 or subwoofers at around $5,000 tend to be incredibly heavy, so reinforcing floors is a must.</p>
           <p><strong>Surround sound set-up:</strong> Whether you have a projector, flat panel TV in a surround sound set up.  The height of the left and right channel speaker is essential.  The placement of surround-left and -right channel is important and is often is placed in a position that plays too loud.</p>
