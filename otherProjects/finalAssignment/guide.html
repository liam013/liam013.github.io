The journey to hi-fi audio can be affordable and we'll do our best to steer you clear of the snake oil that can really hurt the bank.</p>

<h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Things to avoid: </h3>
 <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
        <p><strong>Expensive DACs.</strong> Digital-to-Analgoue Converters are getting cheaper and cheaper these days.  A Schiit Modi DAC ($99) is really all you need, the only reason to look elsewhere would be for form-factor or a set of specific inputs.  The Objective2 ODAC is a good alternative and can be purchased for around $160.</p>
     
        <p><strong>Expensive Cables.</strong>  Many people will insist that using $20,000 diamond crusted-oxygen free cables is the 'only way to enjoy music' is simply delusional.  Changing out cables can potentially provide a minor increase in quality, if and only if, the original cable you had, had a high output impedence which has been known to happen but not an absolute.  Only spend more than you need to on cables for the length (if its a a cable sending a digital signal, such as an HDMI cable), or if it's being custom made to fit a propriatary input mechanism (common in a majority of Sennheiser, Shure, and HiFiMan headphones).</p>

     <h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Digital vs Analogue Debate</h3>
    <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
        <p>If possible ignore this discussion entirely, if it ever comes up.  The old-guard audiophiles will swear by vinyl and analogue records because it's "how it was always/meant to be done" which translates to 'that's how music I like is done, so that's the right and only way to listen to music'.  Let me just proclaim this ahem.. DIGITAL HAS SURPASSED ANALOGUE IN NEARLY EVREY CONCIEVIBLE WAY INCLUDING SOUND QUALITY, ACCESSIBILTY, AND CONVIENCE.  There are many technical reasons for this, one is that on vinyl LP's the bass is recorded in mono because if it wasn't the physical grooves on the vinyl would bump the needle off the LP causing the 'record' to skip.  Vinyl also has a big noise floor, which is often a liking for some as they feel vinyl is 'warmer, smooth and more forgiving' when in acuality it's cracks, pops, and ultimately an inaccurate reproduction of the bass.   </p>

        <h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Streaming Services are A-OK</h3>
    <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
            <p>Yes, streaming services such as Spotify and Apple music are fine, great even.  Premium Spotify users can stream 320kbps ogg files, no it's not FLAC but as someone who can desern a difference, it's minimal at most and you really have to strain to hear it, let alone have a system and the ear to notice it's exitence.  I am an avid Spotify user and streaming music is most convient and for most the sound quality is identical.</p>
