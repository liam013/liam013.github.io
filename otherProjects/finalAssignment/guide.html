        <p><strong>Sound Signature: </strong>consistent representation of certain frequencies (the general sound of the headphone) for example: warm, neutral, bright and V-shaped.<p>
                   
        <p><strong>Warm: </strong>adequate low frequencies, emphasized bass and midrange.  Often considered pleasant.</p>
     
        <p><strong>Neutral: </strong>a relatively flat response in all ranges </p>
                   
        <p><strong>Bright: </strong>emphasis on the upper midrange and treble </p>
                   
        <p><strong>V-Shaped: </strong>emphasis on bass and treble with recessed midrange</p>
        
        <p><strong>Analytical: </strong>highly detailed sound </p>
                   
        <p><strong>Sound Stage: </strong>sonic imaging. Sounds provide separation between instruments with width, depth and height</p>
                   
        <p><strong>Open-backed headphones: </strong> The <i>open-back</i> refers to there being free flowing air between the outward facing portion of the driver.  Open-back headphones generally deliver a more impressive sound and have a better <i>sound stage</i>. Being open, these headphones don't isolate outside noise and will leak the sound of whatever you are listening to into the environment around you.   </p>

        <p><strong>Closed-backed headphones: </strong>Closed-back headphones are more common, espeically at the lower price points.  The outward portion of the driver is <i>closed off</i>, usually by hard plastic or metal. Closed-back headphones generally deliver a less impressive sound, but that's not always the case.  Since the enclousure is more confined, lower frequencies (the bass) can sometimes hit harder than open back headphones.  Closed backed headphones isolate more and don't leak as much sound to the outside world.</p>

           <p>Here's a quick break down of a typical audio chain and where your should be focus should be in terms of starting out or upgrading.  Beware of the placebo effect.  The journey to hi-fi audio can be affordable and we'll do our best to steer you clear of the snake oil that can really hurt the bank.</p>

<h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Things to avoid: </h3>
 <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
        <p><strong>Expensive DACs.</strong> Digital-to-Analgoue Converters are getting cheaper and cheaper these days.  A Schiit Modi DAC ($130) is really all you need, the only reason to look elsewhere would be for form-factor or a set of specific inputs.  The Objective2 ODAC is a good alternative and can be purchased for around $160.</p>
     
        <p><strong>Expensive Cables.</strong>  Many people will insist that using $20,000 diamond crusted, oxygen-free cables is the 'only way to enjoy music' ... they're simply delusional.  Changing out cables can potentially provide a minor increase in quality, if and only if, the original cable you had, had a high output impedence which has been known to happen in some manufactuerer's stock cables but not an absolute.  Only spend more than you need to on cables for the length (if its a a cable sending a digital signal, such as an HDMI cable), or if it's being custom made to fit a propriatary locking mechanism (common in a majority of Sennheiser, Shure, and HiFiMan headphones).</p>

     <h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Digital vs Analogue Debate: </h3>
    <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
        <p>If possible ignore this discussion entirely, if it ever comes up.  The old-guard audiophiles will swear by vinyl and analogue records because it's "how it always was/is meant to be done" which translates to 'that's how music I like is done, so that's the right and only way to listen to music'.  Let me just proclaim this ahem.. DIGITAL HAS SURPASSED ANALOGUE IN NEARLY EVREY CONCIEVIBLE WAY INCLUDING SOUND QUALITY, ACCESSIBILTY, AND CONVIENCE.  There are many technical reasons for this, one is that on vinyl LP's the bass is recorded in mono because if it wasn't the physical grooves on the vinyl would bump the needle off the LP causing the 'record' to skip.  Vinyl also has a big noise floor, which is often a liking for some as they feel vinyl is 'warmer, smooth and more forgiving' when in acuality it's cracks, pops, and ultimately an inaccurate reproduction of the bass.</p>

        <h3 class="aboutSubHeading">Streaming Services are A-OK: </h3>
    <div class="aboutInfo bodyText col-sm-12 col-md-11">
            <p>Yes, streaming services such as Spotify and Apple music are fine, great even.  Premium Spotify users can stream 320kbps ogg files, no it's not FLAC, but as someone who can desern a difference, it's minimal at most and you really have to strain to hear it, let alone have a system and the ear to notice its exitence.  I am an avid Spotify user and streaming music is most convenient and for most the sound quality is optimal.</p>
