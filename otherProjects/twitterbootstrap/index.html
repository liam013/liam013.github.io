           <h3>Let's Get Started</h3>
           <p>Source files do matter, but contrary to popular belief, 320kbps MP3s are fine for a high majority of people. Digital-to-analogue converters matter less and less these days.  Apple products have had reputable DACs in their devices for years now.  If you are content on buying an external DAC do not spend more that $160, most of the DACs priced above that are snake-oil.  Amps matter a fair amount.  Solid state amps are becoming increasingly efficient, transparent in signal and inexpensive.  Tube amps on the other hand are becoming more expensive and inherently colour the audio signal.</p> </div>

           <h3>Favourite Headphones, of All time</h3><p>Over the years I have listened to dozens of headphones across the entire spectrum of price ranges. I have listened to Sennheiser’s flagship HD800 that retail for $1,800, Audeze LCD series, which retail in Canada up to $2,400.  I have come to the conclusion that Grado’s GS1000e that retail for a mere $1,300 were the most enjoyable headphone I have heard.  For the first time those headphones had an uncanny vocal sonic imagining which gave me chills when listening to Tom Waits and Stan Rogers.</p></div>

                       <h3>No replacement for audition</h3><p>Take everything you read online with a grain of salt.  No amount of staring at frequency response graphs or sine and square graphs will tell you with certainty how a particular headphone will sound.  Many aging audiophiles are under the impression that ‘audiophile’ is only accomplished by spending a lot of money on meaningless things, such as diamond studded HDMI cables.  An audiophile is simply someone who values the highest audio-quality they can personally achieve.  No one knows what sounds good to you better than you do, get out and listen to as many headphones as you can before purchasing.</p></div>
